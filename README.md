## Overview
The client wants to open a surf and ice cream shop on Oahu. The client has found that the success of the business relates to the weather at the specific location. The client has asked for data on the precipitation for August 23,2016 to July 10, 2017.

Another analysis was performed in connection to a previous analysis to determine if a surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable year-round. Specifically analyzing the temperature data between June and December for the years 2010 to 2016. 

## Results
### Precipitation Data
We can see from the preciptation plot that the precipitation is highest during August, January, April, and July.

### July and December Data
We can see from the temperature comparison between July and December, that December is slightly cooler on average. This is relatively small difference though. There is on average only about a 4 degree temperature difference between the winter months and the summer months. The minimum temperature is about ten degrees less in December.

## Summary
The data here shows that opening up a surf and ice cream shop based on the client's evaluations would be a good choice on Oahu. 

The data analysis team would recommend updating the data set and rerunnning the evaluation criteria in order to take into account and major climate changes within the last 5 years. 

The data analysis team would also recommend the following analyses:
- Comparison of precipitation 
  - Bar graph showing each year's precipitation per month to find any yearly trends. Specifically looking at June and December.
- Monthly anverage temperature comparision
  - Graph to show the average temperature per month to find yearly trends. Specifically looking at June and December.
- How many surf shops and ice cream shops are on the island to determine competition.
